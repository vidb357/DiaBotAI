# Diabetes Assistant Chatbot

## Overview

The **Diabetes Assistant Chatbot** is a web-based application designed to empower users in managing diabetes through risk assessment, personalized meal planning, recipe search, and access to nearby specialists. Developed by **Soumin Mujumdar** and **Vidhi Binwal**, students at SIT Pune, the project leverages **Next.js** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend), integrating the **Gemini AI API** for conversational responses and the **Google Maps API** for location-based doctor searches. The application offers a responsive, user-friendly interface, enabling users to assess diabetes risk, receive tailored Indian meal plans, explore diabetes-friendly recipes, and locate specialists. Users can download **PDF reports** summarizing health insights, making it a comprehensive health-tech solution.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Diabetes Risk Assessment

- **Functionality**: Users initiate a risk assessment by typing "start assessment" in the chatbot or entering health data (e.g., pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age). A **Random Forest Classifier**, trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, predicts risk levels.
- **Process**: The model processes inputs, delivering a risk score (0 or 1), probability, and a risk level (Low: <0.3, Moderate: <0.7, High: ≥0.7).
- **Output**: Provides personalized lifestyle recommendations (e.g., diet, exercise) to mitigate risk.
- **Purpose**: Equips users with data-driven insights for proactive diabetes management.

### 2. Real-Time Doctor Search

- **Functionality**: Users search for specialists by typing "find doctors in [location]" in the chatbot, using the **Google Maps API** to fetch nearby endocrinologists.
- **Features**:
  - Displays doctor details (name, address, contact, ratings) with Google Maps links for directions.
  - Filters results by proximity and relevance.
- **Purpose**: Connects users with healthcare professionals for consultations.

### 3. AI-Powered Education

- **Functionality**: The **Gemini AI API** powers a chatbot that delivers culturally relevant responses on diabetes management, nutrition, and lifestyle.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Answers queries on symptoms, low glycemic index (GI) foods, and meal timing, tailored to Indian cuisine.
  - Includes medical disclaimers, advising professional consultation.
- **Purpose**: Educates users with accurate, accessible information.

### 4. Personalized Meal Planning

- **Functionality**: Generates a 7-day meal plan based on user preferences (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, eggetarian, vegan) and health profile (e.g., allergies, diabetes type).
- **Process**: Users select a start date, and the backend curates daily meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) from a dataset of diabetes-friendly Indian recipes (e.g., Chana Masala, Tandoori Chicken).
- **Output**: Meals include calories, carbs, glycemic index, ingredients, instructions, and nutritional benefits, displayed in an accordion interface.
- **Purpose**: Supports stable blood sugar levels through structured meal plans.

### 5. Recipe Search

- **Functionality**: Users search for diabetes-friendly Indian recipes by keywords (e.g., "dal", "paneer").
- **Process**: The backend filters local recipes and uses **Gemini AI** to generate additional recipes matching user constraints.
- **Output**: Recipes include calories, carbs, glycemic index, and diabetes-specific tips (e.g., portion control).
- **Purpose**: Helps users discover suitable recipes for dietary needs.

### 6. User Profile Management

- **Functionality**: Users input and update health data (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, diet type, allergies, diabetes type, blood sugar, medications).
- **Process**: Profile data is stored in memory to personalize meal plans, recipes, and chatbot responses.
- **Output**: A profile tab enables editing with input validation.
- **Purpose**: Ensures personalized recommendations respect user restrictions.

### 7. PDF Report Generation

- **Functionality**: Users download a **PDF report** summarizing risk assessment results, including risk score, probability, health metrics, and prevention strategies.
- **Implementation**: Uses **jsPDF** for client-side generation, with potential **ReportLab** backend support.
- **Purpose**: Provides a record for users or healthcare providers.

### 8. Responsive Design

- **Functionality**: A **Tailwind CSS**-based interface ensures usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Features**:
  - Tabbed navigation for risk assessment, meal planning, recipe search, chatbot, and profile.
  - Interactive components (accordions, dialogs, toast notifications) and smooth scrolling.
- **Purpose**: Delivers a seamless user experience.
